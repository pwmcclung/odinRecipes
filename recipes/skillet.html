<h2>Ingredients: </h2>

    <li>2 teaspoons oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, diced </li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
    <li>1 1/4 lbs lean ground beef </li>
    <li>1 (12 oz) can evaporated milk</li>
    <li>1 eight ounce can tomato sauce </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons pickle relish</li>
    <li>2 table spoons dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
    <li>2 cups beef broth </li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups macaroni</li>
    <li>3 cups shredded cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions: </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Melt butter with oil in a deep cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add minced garlic and ground beef; cook and stir, breaking up the meat with a spatula, until beef is crumbly and browned, about 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in tomato sauce and evaporated milk. Add pickle relish, Dijon mustard, granulated garlic, granulated onion, Montreal steak seasoning, chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper, and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Reserve 1/4 cup beef broth, and pour remaining beef broth into the skillet. Whisk flour and the 1/4 cup beef broth together in a small bowl to make a slurry; stir slurry into the skillet.</li>
    <li>Stir in dry macaroni until pasta is fully submerged. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, covered, until macaroni is tender with a bite, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Set a rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler.</li>
    <li>Stir 2 cups cheese into macaroni mixture. Sprinkle remaining cheese evenly across the top of the skillet. Broil until cheese is golden, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
